# Elastic Collision Pi
This project has a block of a mass of 1 kg with a velocity of 0 m/s. Another block with a mass of m approaches towards the other block with a velocity of 1 m/s. The system has no friction and all collisions are elastic. The number of collisions are counted. If m of block to falls into the category of m^even_number, then the number of collisions ends up being some digits of PI.
